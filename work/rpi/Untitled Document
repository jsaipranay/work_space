1.JTAG pin configuration program:

download JtagEnabler.cpp for Rpi1 from internet and crosscompile it and generate a.out and put executable(./a.out)in the SD card partition.

*****************************************************

2.Enabling JTAG pins :

After SD card flashed , put it in the board's SD card slot.Then After when kernel boot and you get the prompt, go to the directory where ./a.out was kept and execute it.

username and password to login into board :
username : pi
password : raspberry

******************************************************

3.Trace32 :

After making connection as shown in the wiki image , launch trace32 and execute below commnad in t32 prompt.
SYSTEM.CPU ARM1176JZF
and then as shown in attched image tronchip.png , untick all the exceptions listed under "set" tab .Then execute below command
SYSTEM.CPUACCESS Enable
SYSTEM.MODE ATTACH
DATA.LOAD.ELF c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\new\linux-rpi-3.10.y\vmlinux /NOCODE[copy vmlinux file from linux to window using winscp]
Y.SPATH.SRD c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\new\linux-rpi-3.10.y\

Now , you are ready to set the breakpoint and debug ,but this will let you to debug only kernel code in which you have place
breakpoint and if application call that function but you will not able to debug the code which is executing in the start of the kernel
becuase we are enabling JTAG pins after kernel boots ; so to debug at kernel booting level , implement the JtagEnable.cpp logic
before kernel boots at uboot level.
